              <h1>Madam CJ Walker</h1>
              <h2>December 23,1867 Delta,LA</h2>
              <h2>By Desiree Slappey</h2>


              <p>Madam CJ Walker inspired me because she was a black women who wanted to help other black girl and women.
                 Even though people would try to bring her down she still keep her head up high and worked hard to achachieve her 
                 goals. She also worked hard to get where she was at. Madam CJ Walker had a opopportunity and ran with it. That shows
                 always try hard if you want something and never give up. </p>
